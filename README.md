### Tech

PairUp uses a number of APIs to work properly:

* Google Sheets API - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* Google Places API - Allows for Location based Pairing.
* Bootstrap - improving front-end design.
* jQuery - general purpose for Javascript Development

### Installation

PairUp will be available for personal use via a website soon, however if you want to run it locally you'll have to get a Google API key for [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/) and [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro) as well as [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2 or 3 to host a local webserver. requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run,

Install the dependencies and set the API Keys start the server in your local folder with

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```
